Intellectual Property Framework ‚Äì One World Lingo (MVP 1)

All intellectual property associated with the One World Lingo platform is authored in-house and held under the retained IP framework of the parent entity, EcoNexus Systems O√ú (Estonian e-Resident company, registry code 17218648).

This framework ensures the platform is legally protected, modularly licensable, and aligned with both public-good deployment goals and future DAO or grant-compliant redistribution.

    Author Entity: EcoNexus Systems O√ú

    Project/Subsidiary: One World Lingo

    Current Licensing Mode: Exclusive retained use + modular sublicensing

    Public Use Rights: Enabled only via platform deployment or approved funding terms

    Royalty Terms: Optional royalty buyout, as per uploaded documentation

All core codebases, integrations, and architectural logic are original works and internally documented for IP provenance and contribution tracking.


üîê Components Covered by IP Framework:


Component Area	Notes:

SaaS architecture design	Next.js + Supabase stack logic authored in-house

Whisper/DeepL integrations	Wrapper modules + security enforcement logic

User/session management logic	Supabase RLS + custom gating patterns

Usage/billing scaffolding	Tiered access, tokenized quota prep

Deployment logic	Modular pipelines (future offline compatibility)

No part of the One World Lingo MVP is sourced from proprietary vendor logic outside its permitted API access layer. All business-critical functions are replicable and internally authored.

üîÑ Redistribution & Licensing Strategy:

To support long-term DAO adoption, digital commons access, and mission-aligned partnerships, the IP framework includes:

    Non-exclusive sublicensing options for select NGO or DAO partners

    Royalty buyout structure for aligned funding institutions (see memo: ‚ÄúRoyalty Buyout Playbook‚Äù)

    DAO grant-conforming usage clause ‚Äì platform may be deployed for public-good use cases if funding terms are met

    Founder-backed contribution ledger for valuation, equity negotiation, and open cap table modeling

üõ°Ô∏è Legal Summary:

This IP structure allows:

    Transparent auditability and contribution tracking

    Secure author retention of all value-creating logic

    Public-good deployment under defined terms

    Clear separation of investor-funded vs. community-funded deployments
