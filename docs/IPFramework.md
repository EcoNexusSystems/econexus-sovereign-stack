## 🧩 IP Structure by Component

| Area | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Platform Architecture** | Custom SaaS logic | Built in Next.js + Supabase, authored in-house |
| **AI Integration Modules** | Whisper + DeepL pipelines | Wrapped with proprietary security + usage control |
| **User Auth + Gating** | Supabase RLS & modular access logic | Supports multi-tenant deployment |
| **Quota + Billing Logic** | Crypto + fiat scaffolding | Tokenized and fiat-ready with tiered usage |
| **Deployment Pipelines** | Static + serverless workflows | Built for offline-compatible portability |
| **Licensing Control** | Modular enforcement layers | Aligned with revenue-sharing and sublicensing |

⚠️ No proprietary third-party business logic is embedded. All critical infrastructure is independently constructed or API-bound with abstracted integrations.

## 🔄 Licensing & Redistribution Strategy

This MVP is built for **controlled scale** — allowing legal deployment without sacrificing original ownership.

Licensing Pathways Include:

- ✅ **Full asset sale** — with optional royalty trail for strategic divestment  
- 🤝 **Non-exclusive sublicensing** — for mission-aligned operators or public-good partners  
- 📜 **Buyout structure** — available under predefined valuation tiers (see: “Royalty Buyout Playbook”)  
- 🎯 **Deployment-only licensing** — enables safe MVP rollout without source transfer  

This ensures maximum flexibility without compromising long-term authorship integrity.

## 🧾 Royalty & Equity Terms

| Clause | Terms |
|--------|-------|
| **Royalty Model** | 25% perpetual gross-revenue share (if retained) |
| **Buyout Option** | Available via one-time payment (see contract memo) |
| **Cap Table Ready** | Contribution tracking ledger & equity negotiation support |
| **Assignment Compatibility** | Designed for transfer into LTD or HoldCo if needed |
