Business Model:
AI-powered SaaS platform for multilingual transcription and document translation. Optimized for EU regulatory compliance, privacy-first deployment, and modular scalability.

1. Mission Statement:
To deliver rapid, compliant, and user-friendly transcription and translation tools through a scalable, cloud-native SaaS platformâ€”prioritizing privacy, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness for European users and institutions.

2. Current MVP Functionality (Feature Complete):

    Upload .mp3 or .wav â†’ Receive AI-transcribed text via OpenAI Whisper

    Supabase-authenticated dashboard with role-based access control

    Feature scaffolding in place for future subscription and billing tiers

    Deployment-ready infrastructure, pending Stripe integration finalization

3. Core Technical Stack:

Layer	Technology
Frontend	Next.js 15 (App Router) + Tailwind CSS
Backend	Serverless API Routes (Next.js Edge Functions)
Auth	Supabase Auth with session context provider
Database	Supabase PostgreSQL (EU region)
AI/ML	OpenAI Whisper API (transcription), DeepL API (translation)
CI/CD	Local development + Netlify Deploy Hooks (staged)
Dev Tools	VS Code, GitHub Copilot, CodeSandbox

4. Key Architectural Benefits:

    Serverless: Auto-scaled Next.js API endpoints with zero backend maintenance

    Modular: Decoupled components (Supabase, Whisper, DeepL) for extensibility

    Privacy-First: No third-party tracking; all processing is handled client-side or via temporary in-memory API interactions â€” no user files are stored.

    Scalable: Built for linear expansion in user tiers, roles, and services

    Extensible: Stripe + Resend integrations scaffolded and config-ready


5. Compliance & Data Sovereignty:

    All user data and services hosted in GDPR-compliant EU regions

    No behavioral analytics or external cookie injection

    Role-based Row-Level Security (RLS) policies enforced via Supabase

    Email logic (password reset, notifications) pre-wired using Resend templates


6. Infrastructure Status:
