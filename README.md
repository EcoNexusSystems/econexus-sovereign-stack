## 🔍 Public Response to LHV Banking Rejection

This site was part of an **e-Resident startup package** denied a microloan by **LHV Bank, Estonia**. Despite meeting legal and professional standards, rejection was issued solely due to **non-residency**.

🕊️ This only reinforces our mission: to build independent, accessible, post-scarcity tech — without gatekeepers.

---

## 🤝 DAO Collaboration

We are **not open source in the traditional sense** — to avoid extractive forking or VC capture.

We *do* support:
- ✅ Free trials and capped usage for evaluation
- 🤝 DAO-aligned forks and collaborative extensions
- 🧩 Co-governance models under custom licensing
- 🆓 Royalty-free access where DAO values are shared
