# 🧠 EcoNexus Sovereign Stack – Strategic Architecture Repository

This repository contains the strategic blueprint and support infrastructure for **EcoNexus Systems OÜ** — a mission-driven R&D studio building scalable, AI-powered systems for resilient global infrastructure.

This is the foundation layer powering all EcoNexus MVPs, including the ready-to-launch **OneWorldLingo** platform.

## 🌐 Company Overview

**EcoNexus Systems OÜ** is a founder-led software studio structured to launch **lean, self-sustaining AI infrastructure products** that solve real-world resilience and autonomy challenges.

Rather than chase scale at any cost, EcoNexus focuses on **precision-built MVPs** for underserved domains:

- 🛰️ Crisis communication & continuity tools  
- 🌍 Privacy-aligned, multilingual AI platforms  
- 🧩 Decentralized and modular field systems  
- 🔐 Sovereign-by-design infrastructure (DAO-ready)

This repo houses the **governance logic, system architecture, and modular frameworks** for all current and future launches.

## 🏗️ Role of This Repo

The `econexus-sovereign-stack` repo is **not a product** — it is a mission architecture.

It includes:

- 🔧 Deployment frameworks and code scaffolds
- 🧭 IP structure and royalty logic for MVPs
- 📊 Pricing & licensing structures for SaaS billing models
- 💼 Transfer-ready documentation for ownership handoff
- 📜 Internal audit trails of authorship, IP, and licensing rights

This is what enables EcoNexus to **reliably scale** new MVPs without overhead or centralization.

- 25% gross-revenue royalty to parent unless otherwise restructured during sale

This repo contains all supporting logic for clean, **audit-ready project transfers**.
